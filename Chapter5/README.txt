In Chapter 5, I developed an interface for the bag ADT. I then used this specification to implement an unsorted bag using first the array and then the linked list from Chapter 4. Both classes implement the interface functionality identically, although there are always time and space trade offs based on implentation choice.

I then implemented an array-based set and an array-based sorted bag that inherited from the array-based bag class.
